# Microgrid Transactive Energy Management Smart Contract

The microgrid dApp aims to assist the power exchange between cosumers and prosumers through a transparent and secure management platform.

## DApps

Generic flowcharts and pseudocodes of the proposed systems are avaliable within this repository: [pseudo-code/README.md](pseudo-code/README.md)


A first draft of the dApps can be seen [here](neo-dapp/microgrid-dapp.cs), which is being designed for interacting with the [NEO Blockchain](https://github.com/neo-project/neo).
